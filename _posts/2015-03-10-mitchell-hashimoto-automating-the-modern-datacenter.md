On March 10th, we hosted a meetup in Pakhuis de Zwijger in Amsterdam on automating modern data centers. Thanks to all of you guys and gals from the Dutch Devops Engineers and the Docker Randstad meetup groups the venue was packed! Mitchell Hashimoto of Hashicorp, the creator of tools like Vagrant, Consul and Terraform, joined us and delivered a very interesting talk about his vision on automating data centers. He also joined us during the hands-on session where we showed how you can use Docker in conjunction with Consul and Vagrant to create production-like load-balanced environments, right on your laptop
